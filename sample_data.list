6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0002.flac	I THINK I SENT HIM SOME THAT PLEASED HIM ANYHOW HE PAID FOR THEM ALL RIGHT I HAD A CUSTOMER WHO WANTED A RATTLESNAKE WITH A VERY BIG RATTLE AND I FIXED UP A SNAKE FOR HIM ON THIS TRIP AND SENT IT TO HIM AFTERWARDS IT HAD ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN RATTLES
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0003.flac	I GLUED A LOT OF RATTLES TOGETHER AND BY TAKING OFF THE BUTTONS IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE JOINED THIS RATTLE WAS MORE THAN A FOOT LONG THERE WAS ANOTHER EASTERN CHAP WANTED AN IBEX WHICH HE SAID WAS FOUND UP IN THESE MOUNTAINS
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0004.flac	IT HAD LIGHT COLORED HORNS CURVED OVER AT THE TIPS LIKE A CHAMOIS AND STRIPED LEGS AND EYES THAT STUCK OUT LIKE AN ANTELOPE HE HAD HEARD ABOUT THE IBEX AND WANTED A PAIR I TOLD HIM I HAD OFTEN KILLED THEM BUT THEY WERE HARD TO GET
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0005.flac	WHAT IS AN IBEX I ASKED I'LL BE HANGED IF I KNOW ANSWERED THE COLLECTOR BUT THERE ARE FELLOWS IN THESE MOUNTAINS WHO SAY THAT THERE REALLY ARE SUCH ANIMALS AND IF HE WANTED TO HAVE AN IBEX AND HAD TO HAVE AN IBEX
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0006.flac	I MIGHT AS WELL GET HIM AN IBEX AS ANYBODY ELSE EVEN IF I HAD TO MAKE ONE BUT TO GET BACK TO MY STORY
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0007.flac	WHICH MIGHT PROVE SALABLE MY OUTFIT CONSISTED OF TWO WAGONS FIVE HORSES AND I HAD A MEXICAN ALONG TO LOOK AFTER THE TEAMS AND DO THE COOKING AFTER BEING OUT SOME TWO WEEKS WE FOUND OURSELVES NEAR WHAT IS CALLED MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE UP BY THE VERDE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0008.flac	THERE ARE A LOT OF CAVES SCATTERED ABOUT UP THERE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0009.flac	AND MANY OF THEM HAD NEVER BEEN TOUCHED OR EXAMINED I HAD AN OFFER OF GOOD MONEY FOR A MUMMY
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0010.flac	THE BONES ARE NOT CRUMBLY ENOUGH AND THE RAGS WHICH THE REAL MUMMIES ARE DONE UP IN ARE PRETTY DIFFICULT TO IMITATE I WAS MIGHTY ANXIOUS TO EXPLORE THE BIG CAVES SO OFF WE WENT TO THE PLACE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0011.flac	AND I TELL YOU THE OLD RUIN THEY CALL MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE IS A DANDY AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT THE CASTLE IS BUILT ON A LEDGE HIGH UP ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH HANGS OVER AT THE TOP THE ONLY WAY TO GET UP IS BY LADDERS OR ROPES
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0012.flac	RIGHT NEAR THERE ON THE FACE OF THE HIGH CLIFF THERE ARE A LOT OF FINE OLD CLIFF DWELLINGS AND SOME OF THEM ARE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE BASE THESE CLIFFS ARE STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN SOMETIMES NEARLY SMOOTH BUT OFTEN WITH NARROW BROKEN LEDGES HERE AND THERE ON THE FACE OF THE WALL
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0013.flac	AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF I WISHED TO EXPLORE ONE OF THESE CAVES
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0014.flac	I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING TWO VERY GOOD LADDERS ONE FOURTEEN FEET LONG WITH THE TWO TOP POLES ONE FROM EACH TENT AND TWO SMALL LADDERS EACH ABOUT SEVEN FEET I MADE THESE LAST FROM THE FOUR UPRIGHT TENT POLES THERE BEING TWO TO EACH TENT AS YOU KNOW
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0015.flac	THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF WAS ROUGH AND THE FIRST FIFTEEN FEET OR SO WE COULD CLIMB EASILY TO A BROAD LEDGE THEN THERE CAME A SPACE BETWEEN NINE AND TEN FEET IN HEIGHT
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0016.flac	HERE MY FIRST LADDER WAS PUT UP TWO SMALL LEDGES ABOVE THIS SOME THREE FEET APART AND A WIDER LEDGE FOUR FEET HIGHER ALLOWED ME TO CLIMB UP WITHOUT THE USE OF LADDERS TO ANOTHER LEDGE FROM HERE I RAN ANOTHER SMALL LADDER UP TO A LEDGE WHICH WAS BETWEEN TWO AND THREE FEET WIDE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0017.flac	FROM THIS LEDGE TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET AND MY FOURTEEN FOOT LADDER ANSWERED FINELY BUT THE DIFFICULTY WAS IT HAD TO STAND SO STRAIGHT THAT IT WAS RATHER TICKLISH BUSINESS GOING UP ONE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT A SLIP OR A LITTLE BACKWARD JERK
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0018.flac	AND AS FROM THE LEDGE WHERE IT STOOD TO THE BOTTOM WAS SOME FORTY FEET A TUMBLE ON TO THE ROCKS WOULD PROVE MOST UNPLEASANT HOWEVER MY MEXICAN ANTONIO
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0019.flac	I HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN I FELT PRETTY SURE IT HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN VISITED BY ANY ONE SINCE THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS LEFT IT THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO TAKE A STOUT PIECE OF TWINE FROM MY POCKET AND FASTEN THE END OF THE LADDER TO A PIECE OF ROCK THEN I FELT EASIER
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0020.flac	THERE WERE NUMEROUS BITS OF BROKEN POTTERY SCATTERED ABOUT AND ONE NEARLY PERFECT SPECIMEN BESIDES THESE THERE WAS A VERY INTERESTING BIT OF STONE CARVING THESE THINGS I GATHERED TOGETHER AND PLACED IN A HEAP NEAR THE ENTRANCE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0021.flac	I THEN WENT BACK AND TAKING A SMALL HATCHET WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0022.flac	AND PRETTY SOON FOUND THIS LITTLE CHILD MUMMY
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0023.flac	AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE I WAS CAREFUL AND DID NOT HURRY MATTERS AND THE CAVE WAS LIKE AN OVEN WRAPPING THE LITTLE MUMMY CAREFULLY IN A BIG HANDKERCHIEF WHICH I HAD TIED ROUND MY NECK
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0024.flac	IT REACHED HIM SAFELY BUT WHILE HE WAS UNTYING IT I CARELESSLY DROPPED THE END OF THE STRING I WENT BACK HOWEVER AND GATHERED UP THE OTHER RELICS INTENDING TO TAKE SOME OF THEM DOWN WITH ME AND THEN COME BACK FOR THE REST IF I COULD NOT MANAGE THEM ALL THE FIRST TIME
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0025.flac	WHILE I WAS LOOKING THEM OVER I HEARD A CRASH AND THE SOUND OF TUMBLING STONES
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0026.flac	AND COMMENCED TO CURSE ANTONIO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS BUT IMAGINE MY HORROR WHEN I SAW HIM THROW DOWN THE BOTTOM LADDER AND THEN RUN AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS THE CAMP MY FIRST AND ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO PAY ANTONIO FOR HIS TREACHERY
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0027.flac	IT WAS EVIDENTLY HIS INTENTION TO LEAVE ME SAFELY HOUSED IN A PLACE FROM WHICH I COULD NEVER ESCAPE ALIVE AND START OFF THE PROUD OWNER OF THE TWO WAGONS FIVE HORSES AND VARIOUS VALUABLES WHICH HE BELIEVED MY BOXES TO CONTAIN
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0028.flac	MY REVOLVER WAS STILL IN MY BELT AND HASTILY PULLING IT I COMMENCED SHOOTING AT THE RUNNING FIGURE NOW SOME SIXTY OR SEVENTY YARDS DISTANT
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0029.flac	THE SECOND WAS STILL WORSE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0030.flac	AND FELL AMONG SOME LOOSE ROCKS IN A WAY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN UNPLEASANT
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0031.flac	AFTER THAT HE LAY PRETTY QUIET ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT I SAW HIM MOVE HIS ARM ONCE OR TWICE I RELOADED HAVING PLENTY OF CARTRIDGES IN MY BELT AND BEGAN SHOOTING AT HIM AGAIN THIS TIME I HIT HIM THREE TIMES OUT OF SIX SHOTS
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0032.flac	THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OVER HOW I WAS GOING TO GET DOWN
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0033.flac	IT LOOKED VERY CLEAR AND REFRESHING I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THE MORE I THOUGHT THE MORE HOPELESS IT SEEMED TO ME TO PLAN A WAY TO GET DOWN ALIVE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0034.flac	I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOT EVEN A STRING TO AID ME IN GETTING DOWN THERE WAS NO USE HOPING FOR HELP FROM ANY ONE FOR THE PLACE WAS RARELY VISITED AND IT MIGHT BE WEEKS BEFORE ANY PERSON WOULD DISCOVER THAT I WAS THERE I WAS GETTING MORE THIRSTY ALL THE TIME
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0035.flac	AND AT LAST I HATED TO GO TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE HOT AS IT WAS INSIDE BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF THE WATER NEARLY DROVE ME MAD I AMUSED MYSELF BY OCCASIONALLY TAKING A SHOT AT ANTONIO I HAD HIS RANGE DOWN PRETTY FINE NOW
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0036.flac	ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS THERE WAS ONE TALL PEAK WHICH I COULD SEE UP THE CANYON
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0037.flac	BRIGHT AND SHINING EVEN AFTER THE CANYON HAD BECOME QUITE DARK
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0038.flac	FOR A FEW MINUTES IT SHONE A FIERY RED AND THEN THE LIGHT WAS GONE LIKE A HUGE TORCH WHICH FLICKERS AND GOES OUT THEN THE NIGHT NOISES COMMENCED THE INCESSANT MADDENING CROAKING OF THE FROGS AND NOW AND THEN AN OWL
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0039.flac	DID YOU EVER HEAR THE FROGS IN ARIZONA I RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WELL THEN
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0040.flac	AND KNOW THEY CAN GIVE EASTERN FROGS CARDS AND SPADES AND BEAT THEM EASY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU ARE REALLY THIRSTY PROBABLY NOT I ANSWERED WELL CONTINUED THE CURIOSITY DEALER I KNEW NOTHING COULD BE DONE UNTIL MORNING
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0041.flac	SO I LAY DOWN AND TRIED TO SLEEP I WAS VERY NERVOUS AND COULD NOT HELP FEARING THAT IN THE NIGHT I MIGHT WALK IN MY SLEEP OR ROLL TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AND TUMBLE OUT I DO NOT THINK I REALLY SLEPT AT ALL BUT LAY IN A HALF DAZED CONDITION UNTIL IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE THINGS IN THE CANYON BELOW
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0042.flac	STRANGE TO SAY I WAS NOT HUNGRY
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0043.flac	MY WHOLE THOUGHTS WERE CONCENTRATED ON THE ONE DESIRE SOMETHING TO DRINK I THOUGHT AND PONDERED TRYING TO THINK OF SOME POSSIBLE WAY TO GET DOWN
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0044.flac	BUT I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STAY ON IT EVEN IF MY LEGS WERE NOT BROKEN BY THE FALL
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0045.flac	AT LAST A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I MIGHT POSSIBLY MAKE A ROPE OUT OF MY CLOTHES I HAD A LARGE POCKET KNIFE AND A HATCHET
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0046.flac	MY CANVAS COAT SHIRT AND TROUSERS AND SOME THIN UNDERCLOTHES CONSTITUTED MY ENTIRE WARDROBE AND BY CAREFULLY CUTTING THEM INTO STRIPS WIDE ENOUGH TO BEAR MY WEIGHT AND YET NARROW ENOUGH TO GIVE SUFFICIENT LENGTH
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0047.flac	WITH WHICH I HOPED I COULD SUCCEED IN REACHING THE SECOND LADDER WITHOUT BROKEN BONES
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0048.flac	WALKING ABOUT THE CAVE I SUFFERED SO WITH THE HEAT AND THIRST THAT THE HOPE OF ESCAPE ALONE KEPT ME FROM GOING MAD AT LAST THE ROPE WAS DONE AND TIED TOGETHER WITH VARIOUS KNOTS IT HAD A CREEPY SORT OF STRETCHY FEELING WHEN I PULLED ON IT
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0049.flac	BUT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TRUST TO IT IT WAS THAT OR NOTHING AND NOTHING MEANT DEATH FROM THIRST IN A VERY SHORT TIME I SUCCEEDED IN FIXING THE HATCHET FIRMLY INTO AND ACROSS A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE IT WAS SPLIT
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0050.flac	AND IT GAVE ME SOMETHING TO TIE THE ROPE TO WHICH I WAS SATISFIED WOULD HOLD MY WEIGHT I TIED THE END OF THE ROPE TO THE HATCHET HANDLE AND THREW THE OTHER END DOWN
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0051.flac	I WAS STARK NAKED EXCEPTING MY SHOES
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0052.flac	AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FEELING WHICH CAME OVER ME AS I SWUNG MYSELF CLEAR OF THE LEDGE AND HUNG SWAYING ON THAT IMPROVISED ROPE WHICH SEEMED TO STRETCH AND GROW THIN IN A WAY WHICH SENT COLD SHIVERS RUNNING UP AND DOWN MY SPINE IT SEEMED A YEAR BEFORE I REACHED THE LEDGE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0053.flac	I WENT DOWN PRETTY SLOW SPARING THE ROPE AS MUCH AS I COULD BY SUPPORTING PART OF MY WEIGHT BY DIGGING MY TOES INTO EVERY LITTLE CRACK AND CREVICE I COULD FIND BUT I GOT THERE AT LAST AND WHEN I DID I SAT DOWN ON THE LEDGE AND CRIED LIKE A BABY WELL
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0054.flac	OF COURSE I GOT DOWN THE REST OF THE WAY ALL RIGHT OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF ANTONIO HAD PULLED DOWN THE SECOND LADDER INSTEAD OF THE BOTTOM ONE
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0055.flac	AFTER REACHING THE SECOND LADDER
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0056.flac	THE FIRST THING I DID WHEN I GOT DOWN WAS TO RUN AS FAST AS I COULD TO THE RIVER AND DRINK AS MUCH WATER AS I DARED THEN I LAY DOWN IN THE WATER AND ENJOYED IT TALK ABOUT YOUR PARADISE COCKTAILS THEY ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THAT VERDE RIVER WATER WHICH I TASTED THAT DAY
6753	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/6753/76097/6753-76097-0057.flac	ANTONIO OH YES HE IS THERE YET I BELIEVE

111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0036.flac	CAPTAIN THOMAS BY WHICH NAME HE WAS AFTERWARDS KNOWN WHEN THESE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED HE GATHERED HIS CREW TOGETHER AND ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO SAINT THOMAS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0037.flac	TO GET A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER HE HAD DETERMINED TO KEEP ON IN HIS OLD MANNER OF LIFE AND THAT HE WISHED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY WAS HE A PIRATE CAPTAIN BUT THAT THEY WERE A PIRATE CREW
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0038.flac	A VERY NATURAL THING FOR THE GREEN HAND BONNET TO GIVE UP PIRATING AFTER HE HAD BEEN SO THOROUGHLY SNUBBED BY BLACKBEARD AND THEY HAD NOT SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD EVER THINK AGAIN OF SAILING UNDER A BLACK FLAG
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0039.flac	HOWEVER THE CREW'S OPINION OF THE GREEN HAND CAPTAIN HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL CHANGED IN HIS VARIOUS CRUISES
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0040.flac	AND COULD NOW GIVE VERY FAIR ORDERS AND HIS FURIOUS PURSUIT OF BLACKBEARD HAD ALSO GIVEN HIM A REPUTATION FOR RECKLESS BRAVERY WHICH HE HAD NOT ENJOYED BEFORE A MAN WHO WAS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0041.flac	CHAFING AND FUMING FOR A CHANCE OF A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT WITH THE GREATEST PIRATE OF THE DAY
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0042.flac	FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW MOREOVER THEIR STRUTTING AND STALKING CAPTAIN SO RECENTLY BALKED OF HIS DARK REVENGE WAS A VERY SAVAGE LOOKING MAN AND IT WOULD NOT BE PLEASANT EITHER
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0043.flac	TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PIRATICAL INTENTION OR TO DECLINE TO JOIN HIM IN CARRYING IT OUT SO THE WHOLE OF THE CREW MINOR OFFICERS AND MEN CHANGED THEIR MINDS ABOUT GOING TO SAINT THOMAS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0044.flac	AND AGREED TO HOIST THE SKULL AND CROSS BONES AND TO FOLLOW CAPTAIN BONNET WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD BONNET NOW CRUISED ABOUT IN GRAND STYLE AND TOOK SOME PRIZES
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0045.flac	ON THE VIRGINIA COAST AND THEN WENT UP INTO DELAWARE BAY WHERE HE CAPTURED SUCH SHIPS AS HE WANTED AND ACTED GENERALLY IN THE MOST DOMINEERING AND INSOLENT FASHION ONCE WHEN HE STOPPED NEAR THE TOWN OF LEWES
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0046.flac	IN ORDER TO SEND SOME PRISONERS ASHORE HE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE OFFICERS OF THE TOWN TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY INTERFERED WITH HIS MEN WHEN THEY CAME ASHORE HE WOULD OPEN FIRE UPON THE TOWN WITH HIS CANNON
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0047.flac	AND BLOW EVERY HOUSE INTO SPLINTERS OF COURSE THE CITIZENS HAVING NO WAY OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES WERE OBLIGED TO ALLOW THE PIRATES TO COME ON SHORE AND DEPART UNMOLESTED
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0048.flac	THEN AFTER THIS THE BLUSTERING CAPTAIN CAPTURED TWO VALUABLE SLOOPS AND WISHING TO TAKE THEM ALONG WITH HIM WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF TRANSFERRING THEIR CARGOES TO HIS OWN VESSEL
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0049.flac	HE LEFT THEIR CREWS ON BOARD AND ORDERED THEM TO FOLLOW HIM WHEREVER HE WENT SOME DAYS AFTER THAT WHEN ONE OF THE VESSELS SEEMED TO BE SAILING AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE BONNET QUICKLY LET HER CAPTAIN KNOW
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0050.flac	THAT HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE TRIFLED WITH AND SENT HIM THE MESSAGE THAT IF HE DID NOT KEEP CLOSE TO THE ROYAL JAMES HE WOULD FIRE INTO HIM AND SINK HIM TO THE BOTTOM
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0051.flac	AFTER A TIME BONNET PUT INTO A NORTH CAROLINA PORT IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE ROYAL JAMES WHICH WAS BECOMING VERY LEAKY AND SEEING NO IMMEDIATE LEGITIMATE WAY OF GETTING PLANKS AND BEAMS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0052.flac	ENOUGH WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS HE CAPTURED A SMALL SLOOP BELONGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BROKE IT UP IN ORDER TO GET THE MATERIAL HE NEEDED TO MAKE HIS OWN VESSEL SEAWORTHY
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0053.flac	NOW THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST VERY SELDOM INTERFERED WITH PIRATES AS WE HAVE SEEN AND IT IS LIKELY THAT BONNET MIGHT HAVE STAYED IN PORT AS LONG AS HE PLEASED AND REPAIRED AND REFITTED
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0054.flac	HIS VESSEL WITHOUT MOLESTATION IF HE HAD BOUGHT AND PAID FOR THE PLANKS AND TIMBER HE REQUIRED BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BOLDLY SEIZING THEIR PROPERTY
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0055.flac	AND COMPLAINTS OF BONNET'S BEHAVIOR SPREAD FROM SETTLEMENT TO SETTLEMENT AND IT VERY SOON BECAME KNOWN ALL DOWN THE COAST THAT THERE WAS A PIRATE IN NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS COMMITTING DEPREDATIONS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0056.flac	THERE AND WAS PREPARING TO SET OUT ON A FRESH CRUISE
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0057.flac	IT HAD NOT BEEN LONG SINCE BLACKBEARD HAD VISITED THEIR HARBOR AND HAD TREATED THEM WITH SUCH BRUTAL INSOLENCE
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0058.flac	COULD PREVENT ANOTHER VISITATION OF THE PIRATES THAT EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/129000/111-129000-0059.flac	BE SENT OUT TO MEET THE PIRATES WHO WERE COMING DOWN THE COAST
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0000.flac	BUT THE OCEAN WITH ITS CEASELESS MOTION ITS WONDERFUL RISING AND FALLING OF THE TIDES AND ITS CONSTANT AND MYSTERIOUS MOANING IS NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN SUBLIMITY AND OFFERS A KEEN DELIGHT
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0001.flac	TO THE LOVER OF NATURE ITS SANDS AND WATERS ARE EVER CHANGING ITS RUGGED COAST WITH ROCKS SCATTERED IN WILD PROFUSION IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING SPOTS IN ALL THE WORLD
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0002.flac	A PIECE OF WRECKAGE IS THROWN UPON THE BEACH AND YOU WONDER WHAT DIRE DISASTER HAPPENED FAR OUT AT SEA AND IF THE REST OF THE SHIP WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH ALL ON BOARD
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0003.flac	BUT TAKE IT HOME LET IT DRY IN THE SUN THEN PLACE IT ON YOUR OPEN GRATE FIRE AND AS YOU WATCH THE IRIDESCENT BLAZE CURL UP THE CHIMNEY DREAM DREAMS AND WEAVE STRANGE FANCIES
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0004.flac	IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR DRIFTWOOD FIRE A DAY AT THE SEASHORE IS ONE OF PLEASURE A DELIGHTFUL CHANGE FROM WOODS AND UPLANDS TO ROCKS AND RUSHING WATERS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0005.flac	SOME PREFER THE SMOOTH STRETCH OF SANDY BEACH WHERE ONE MAY LIE AT LUXURIOUS EASE IN THE WARM SAND AND LISTEN TO THE WAVES LAPPING ALONG SHORE OR DISCARDING SHOES AND STOCKINGS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0006.flac	WADE OUT UNTIL THE WHITE CAPPED WAVES LIKE POLICEMEN DRIVE YOU BACK FROM ENCROACHING UPON OLD NEPTUNE'S DOMAIN BUT WE PREFER THE ROCKY CLIFFS COMBINED WITH THE SANDY BEACH
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0007.flac	AND SUCH A PLACE IS LAND'S END NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE STARTED DOWN THE STEEP INCLINE STREWN WITH JAGGED ROCKS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0008.flac	TO FOLLOW THE NARROW PATH ALONG THE CLIFFS BUT OUR OUTING WAS MARRED BY MEETING TWO MEN TOILING UP THE PATH ALONG THE NARROW WAY CARRYING AN UNFORTUNATE SIGHTSEER WHO HAD VENTURED TOO NEAR THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0009.flac	AND FALLEN INTO THE OCEAN ONLY THE PROMPT ACTION OF A FRIEND WHO SCRAMBLED DOWN THE ROCKS AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE SAVED HIM
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0010.flac	JUDGING BY HIS AGONIZING GROANS BUT THE AMBULANCE OFFICERS HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND THE UNFORTUNATE SUFFERER WAS CARED FOR AT THE HOSPITAL THE INCIDENT SERVED TO MAKE US MORE CAREFUL AND AT THE NARROWEST PLACE

111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0013.flac	IS A DEEP DARK CAVERN EVIDENTLY WORN BY THE ACTION OF THE WAVES THAT HAVE POUNDED AGAINST IT FOR CENTURIES LOOKING OUT UPON THE OCEAN WE SEE A WAVE MIGHTIER THAN ALL THE OTHERS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0014.flac	SWEEPING ONWARD AS IF CHALLENGING THE ROCKS TO MORTAL COMBAT ITS MIGHTY CURVING CREST WHITE AND SEETHING WITH FOAM

111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0018.flac	TO GUIDE THE STATELY SHIPS BETWEEN THE PORTALS OF THE GOLDEN GATE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE WHITE BUILDINGS OF POINT BONITA

111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0021.flac	WHILE THE ITALIAN FISHING BOATS WITH THEIR QUEER STRIPED SAILS FORM A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE MASSIVE STEAMBOATS WITH SMOKE TRAILING FROM THEIR TWIN FUNNELS THAT ARE OUTWARD BOUND FOR CHINA OR JAPAN

111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0024.flac	WE WATCH THE TIDE COME CREEPING IN EACH SUCCEEDING WAVE RUNNING A LITTLE FARTHER UP THE BEACH AND DRIVING US BACK WITH RELENTLESS ENERGY FROM ITS RIGHTFUL POSSESSIONS
111	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/111/126265/111-126265-0025.flac	THE SUN SINKS DOWN IN GOLDEN SPLENDOR BEHIND THE OCEAN'S RIM LEAVING A TRACK OF MOLTEN GOLD THAT TIPS

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0001.flac	I SAW THAT THE SHOOTING OF THESE LACHINE RAPIDS IS LIKE THE TAMING OF A PARTICULARLY FIERCE LION IT IS A BUSINESS BY ITSELF THAT FEW MEN CARE TO UNDERTAKE SO IT CAME THAT I SOUGHT OUT ONE OF THESE FEW
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0002.flac	THIS UNSOUGHT NOTORIETY HAS MADE HIM SHY HE DOES NOT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HIS WORK OR TELL YOU HOW IT FEELS TO DO THIS THING
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0003.flac	YET CERTAIN FACTS HE VOUCHSAFED WHEN I WENT TO HIS HOME THAT HELP ONE TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PILOT'S LIFE HE EMPHASIZED THIS FOR INSTANCE AS ESSENTIAL IN A MAN WHO WOULD FACE THAT FURY OF WATERS HE MUST NOT BE AFRAID
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0004.flac	BETRAY HIM THE RAPIDS WILL HAVE NO MERCY

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0008.flac	AND THEN IN HIS JERKY CANADIAN SPEECH HE EXPLAINED HOW THIS WAS
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0009.flac	AND IT WAS HIP BAS HIP BAS
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0010.flac	BUT HIS FATHER WOULD LOOK AT HIM AND SAY DO YOU KNOW THE RIVER MY SON ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW THE RIVER AND FRED WOULD ANSWER FATHER I THINK I DO
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0011.flac	SO IT WENT ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND OUILLETTE WAS ALMOST DESPAIRING OF A CHANCE TO SHOW HIMSELF WORTHY OF HIS FATHER'S TEACHING WHEN SUDDENLY THE CHANCE CAME IN A WAY NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0012.flac	BESIDES THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THEY WERE CARRYING A HEAVY LOAD AND THE WIND WAS SOUTHEAST BLOWING HARD THE VERY WIND TO MAKE TROUBLE AT THE BAD PLACES

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0016.flac	HIS IDEA WAS THAT COULD HE ONCE MAKE HIS SON FACE THE WORST OF THIS BUSINESS AND COME OUT UNHARMED THEN NEVER WOULD THE BOY KNOW FEAR AGAIN FOR ALL THE REST WOULD BE EASIER THAN WHAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40470/5620-40470-0017.flac	HAVE YOU LOST ANY LIVES I ASKED REACHING OUT FOR THRILLING STORIES NEVAIR SAID HE EVER COME NEAR IT

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0004.flac	WELL SAID THE PROFESSOR I CAN SEE HIS EYES TWINKLING
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0005.flac	THEY TOOK THE BALLOON SOME MILES OUT OF WASHINGTON THE PROFESSOR INSISTED ON THIS
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0006.flac	AND SENT IT UP ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE WITH AN ANCHOR ROPE HOLDING IT AND A WIRE HANGING DOWN TO A LITTLE HAND DYNAMO OR BLASTING MACHINE AS THEY MADE READY TO TURN THIS DYNAMO PROFESSOR MYERS LAY FLAT ON HIS BACK
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0007.flac	EYES GLUED TO THE BALLOON CONFIDENT BUT CURIOUS THE HANDLE TURNED A SPARK JUMPED AT THE OTHER END AND THE BALL OF SILK

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0011.flac	AND ADOPTED THE PROFESSOR'S SYSTEM FOR EXTENDED RAINFALL EXPERIMENTS ONLY THESE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS WERE REMOVED TO THE LONELY AND ARID PLAINS OF DISTANT TEXAS IT WASN'T MUCH FUN LIVING DOWN THERE SAID THE PROFESSOR
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0012.flac	BUT WE GOT RAIN WHENEVER WE WANTED IT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I INQUIRED IF A VERY LARGE BALLOON FILLED WITH THIS EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE WERE SET OFF OVER A CROWDED CITY THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0013.flac	IT WOULD WORK FEARFUL DESTRUCTION IF LARGE ENOUGH AND THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING SUCH A SIZE
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0014.flac	AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM IT WOULD DESTROY AN ARMY IN THE COURSE OF OUR TALKS I DISCOVERED A MYSTIC SIDE VERY UNEXPECTED IN THE PROFESSOR'S NATURE HE USED TO SPEAK OF HYDROGEN FOR INSTANCE
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0015.flac	AND I SEE NOTHING I HEAR NOTHING I SMELL NOTHING NONE OF MY SENSES ANSWER ANY CALL YET SOMEHOW STRANGELY IN A WAY I CAN'T EXPLAIN I PERCEIVE A PRESENCE
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0016.flac	IT WOULD NOT BE AT ALL THE SAME TO ME WERE THE BALLOON FILLED WITH AIR THOUGH IT WOULD BE THE SAME TO ALL MY SENSES AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAVE NOTED THIS THING THAT HYDROGEN MAKES ITSELF KNOWN TO MEN WHEN THEY ARE NEAR IT
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0017.flac	I MADE NO REMARK BUT BEGGED HIM TO GO ON

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0024.flac	YOU SEE I KNEW I COULD HOLD MY BREATH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECONDS BUT NO LONGER WELL WE CARRIED OUT THE PLAN AND I FREED THE CORDS IN LESS THAN MY LIMIT OF TIME
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0025.flac	IT IS TRUE I HAD AT VARIOUS TIMES TAKEN HYDROGEN INTO MY LUNGS BUT NEVER HAD I TRIED TO SPEAK IN HYDROGEN NOW WAS MY CHANCE
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0026.flac	I SHOUTED AS LOUD AS I COULD INSIDE THAT BALLOON THINK OF IT

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0030.flac	I BELIEVE YOU MIGHT FIRE A CANNON INSIDE A BAG OF HYDROGEN AND NO FAINTEST RUSTLE OF THE DISCHARGE WOULD REACH YOUR EARS SO YOU SEE A WORLD OF HYDROGEN WOULD BE A VOICELESS WORLD
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0031.flac	YES I HAVE BREATHED IT UP TO THE DANGER POINT I KNOW ALL THE SENSATIONS THERE IS FIRST A MILD EXHILARATION THEN A SENSE OF SICKENING AND HEAD THROBBING
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0032.flac	IN MAKING ASCENSIONS WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BREATHE TOO MUCH GAS FROM THE BALLOON NECK WHICH HANGS OPEN OVER THE BASKET MORE THAN ONE AERONAUT HAS BEEN GRADUALLY OVERCOME WITHOUT REALIZING THAT HE WAS IN DANGER
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0033.flac	THE PROFESSOR WENT ON TO TELL OF OTHER SINGULAR THINGS ABOUT THIS SUBTLE GAS NOTABLY THAT SPEAKING WITHIN LIMITS THE HIGHER YOU WANT A BALLOON TO RISE THE LESS
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0034.flac	IF YOU FILL A BALLOON FULL OF HYDROGEN IT WILL RISE TO NO GREAT HEIGHT AND IS VERY APT TO BURST SINCE THE GAS HAS NO SPACE TO EXPAND IN

5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0036.flac	GENERAL HAZEN AND I SAID THE PROFESSOR ONCE PLANNED THAT SOME DAY WHEN WE GOT AN APPROPRIATION WE WOULD GO UP IN A BALLOON HAVING A CAPACITY OF SAY FORTY THOUSAND CUBIC FEET
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0037.flac	BUT CARRYING AT THE GROUND ONLY TEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN IN OTHER WORDS IN A SHRUNKEN QUARTER FILLED BALLOON
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0038.flac	OF COURSE AS WE ROSE AND THE AIR BECAME RAREFIED THIS HYDROGEN WOULD EXPAND AGAINST THE DECREASING AIR PRESSURE AND AT A HEIGHT OF TWO MILES OUR ORIGINAL TEN THOUSAND FEET OF GAS MIGHT HAVE SWELLED TO TWENTY THOUSAND FEET AT FIVE MILES TO THIRTY THOUSAND FEET
5620	/home/wuliu/datasets/LibriSpeech/train-other-500/5620/40466/5620-40466-0039.flac	BUT CERTAINLY WE CALCULATED TO THE GREATEST HEIGHT EVER REACHED BY A BALLOONIST HE EXPLAINED THAT THE BALLOON RECORD OF SEVEN MILES CLAIMED FOR GLAISCHER AND COXWELL THE ENGLISH AERONAUTS IS NOT RELIABLE SINCE THE BAROMETER USED IN THAT FAMOUS ASCENSION
